# Traffic-sign-classification-using-CNN
1.All the necessary libraries were imported. <br />
2.mage visualization was done. <br />
3.The RGB images were normalized and also converted to grayscale images(with 1 channel). <br />
4.The CNN model was built using tensorflow and keras using "Sparse categorical cross entropy" as the Loss function. <br />
5.The training performance was assessed using accuracy as the metric. <br />
6.The model was then evaluated on the test set. <br />
