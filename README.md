# Traffic-sign-classification-using-CNN
#.All the necessary libraries were imported.
#.Image visualization was done.
#.The RGB images were normalized and also converted to grayscale images(with 1 channel).
#.The CNN model was built using tensorflow and keras using "Sparse categorical cross entropy" as the Loss function.
#.The training performance was assessed using accuracy as the metric.
#.The model was then evaluated on the test set
